### About

C3SV is C library for parsing csv files that I'm working on. I had to start over because I didn’t have an optimal start, but now I have [Lib3man](https://github.com/3manuel0/lib3man)(my C library) to help me simplify things and make my work easier.

### Goals

- The ability to parce csv and create a csv object.
- Have support for most types used in csv (doubles, ints, strings etc...).
- Printing and formating the file in a human readable way.
- Change csv object and save it as a file.
- Create a new CSV file from some data.
